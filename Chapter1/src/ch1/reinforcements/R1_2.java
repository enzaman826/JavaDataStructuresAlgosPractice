    Suppose that we create an array A of GameEntry objects, which has an integer
    scores field, and we clone A and store the result in an array B. If we then immediately
    set A[4].score equal to 550, what is the score value of the GameEntry
    object referenced by B[4]?

    If B is a clone of the array A, it means that each entry of B is a copy of the corresponding entry of A.
    Changing any entries in A will not affect B and vice/versa.
